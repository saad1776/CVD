# Analysis of Computational and Statistical Methods in the Cardiovascular Risk Study

## Code and Simulation Analysis

After thoroughly reviewing the paper by Petkeviciene et al. (2015), I found that **no custom code or simulations** are explicitly mentioned in the traditional sense. However, the study does involve significant computational work through statistical analysis. Here's what I discovered:

## Statistical Software and Methods Used

The authors explicitly state: **"All statistical analyses were performed using statistical software package SPSS version 20.0 for Windows."**

## Computational Methods Summary Table

| **Computational Aspect** | **Method/Tool Used** | **Purpose** | **Implementation Details** |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Statistical Software** | SPSS version 20.0 for Windows | Primary analysis platform | Commercial statistical package |
| **Data Distribution Testing** | Kolmogorov-Smirnov test | Test normality of continuous variables | Built-in SPSS function |
| **Correlation Analysis** | Spearman correlation coefficients | Assess childhood-adulthood associations | Non-parametric correlation |
| **Group Comparisons** | χ² test | Compare categorical variables | Standard statistical test |
| **Mean Comparisons** | Student t-test, ANOVA | Compare normally distributed variables | Parametric tests |
| **Non-parametric Comparisons** | Mann-Whitney test | Compare non-normal distributions | Alternative to t-test |
| **Predictive Modeling** | Logistic regression models | Predict cardiovascular risk factors | Multiple models with adjustments |
| **Interaction Testing** | Interaction terms in regression | Test effect modification by sex | Statistical modeling technique |
| **Data Categorization** | Quintile analysis | Group childhood BMI into 5 categories | Data stratification method |

## Key Computational Formulas Mentioned

1. **BMI Calculation**: BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²)
2. **Standard Alcohol Units (SAUs)**: SAUs = amount (litres) × strength of alcoholic drink
   - Beer: 5%, Wine: 12%, Strong alcohol: 40%
   - One SAU = 10g of ethanol

## Statistical Analysis Workflow

The computational approach follows this sequence:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Normality testing using Kolmogorov-Smirnov
   - Data categorization (quintiles for BMI)
   - Variable transformation and coding

2. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - Means and standard deviations for normal distributions
   - Medians and interquartile ranges for non-normal distributions
   - Percentage calculations for categorical variables

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Spearman correlation coefficients between childhood and adult measurements
   - Significance testing (P < 0.001 threshold)

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Separate logistic regression models for each risk factor
   - Adjustment for confounders (sex, physical activity, alcohol, smoking, family history)
   - Interaction term testing for sex modification

## Implications for Replication

While no custom code is provided, the study could be replicated using:

- **SPSS**: As originally used
- **R**: Using packages like `stats`, `car`, `MASS`
- **Python**: Using `scipy.stats`, `sklearn`, `statsmodels`
- **SAS**: Alternative commercial statistical software

## Missing Computational Elements

The paper lacks:
- Detailed code scripts or syntax
- Power analysis calculations
- Sample size justification computations
- Missing data handling algorithms
- Model validation procedures (cross-validation, bootstrap)

This analysis shows that while the study doesn't involve complex simulations or custom algorithms, it represents a comprehensive application of standard biostatistical methods using established software tools.
