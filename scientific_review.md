# Scientific Review: Anthropometric Measurements in Childhood and Prediction of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adulthood

## Introduction

The study by Petkeviciene et al. (2015) [1] investigates the long-term associations between anthropometric measurements taken during childhood and the development of cardiovascular risk factors in adulthood. This longitudinal cohort study, based on the Kaunas Cardiovascular Risk Cohort, addresses a critical public health concern: the rising prevalence of childhood obesity and its potential implications for adult cardiovascular health. The research aims to clarify whether childhood adiposity independently predicts adult cardiovascular risk or if these associations are primarily driven by the tracking of body mass index (BMI) from childhood into adulthood.

## Methodology

The study followed participants from the Kaunas Cardiovascular Risk Cohort, initially examined at 12â€“13 years old in 1977, with a 35-year follow-up in 2012 (n=506). In childhood, measurements included height, weight, and triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses. In adulthood, health examinations encompassed blood pressure (BP), BMI, waist circumference, glucose, lipids, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The researchers employed logistic regression models to assess the associations of childhood BMI and skinfold thicknesses, as well as BMI gain, with adult cardiovascular risk factors. All models were adjusted for potential confounders such as sex, physical activity level, alcohol consumption, smoking, and family history of obesity.

## Key Findings

The study yielded several significant findings:

*   **Tracking of Anthropometric Measurements:** Anthropometric measurements in childhood, particularly weight and BMI, significantly correlated with their adult values, indicating a strong tracking effect over 35 years. This correlation was slightly higher in women than in men.

*   **Childhood BMI and Adult Cardiovascular Risk:** Childhood BMI was found to be a significant predictor of adult obesity, central obesity, metabolic syndrome, hyperglycaemia or type 2 diabetes, and elevated high-sensitivity CRP. Importantly, these associations remained significant even after adjusting for BMI gain from childhood to adulthood, suggesting an independent effect of childhood adiposity.

*   **Skin-fold Thicknesses as Predictors:** Similar to BMI, childhood skinfold thicknesses also predicted adult obesity, central obesity, metabolic syndrome, hyperglycaemia or type 2 diabetes, and elevated high-sensitivity CRP. The study noted that the associations of skinfold thicknesses with cardiovascular risk factors were comparable in magnitude to those of BMI.

*   **Differential Impact on Risk Factors:** The study observed that childhood BMI and skinfold thicknesses were not predictive of adult arterial hypertension, raised triglycerides, or reduced HDL cholesterol. Instead, these risk factors were more strongly associated with BMI gain from childhood to adulthood, independently of initial childhood BMI.

*   **Implications for Prevention:** The findings underscore that the impact of adiposity on cardiovascular risk begins early in life. The authors suggest that prevention of adult obesity should target not only overweight children but also those in the upper part of the normal weight range, especially given the contemporary obesogenic environment.

## Discussion and Conclusion

This research provides compelling evidence that childhood anthropometric measures are crucial long-term predictors of several adult cardiovascular risk factors, even when accounting for BMI changes into adulthood. The distinction between risk factors predicted by childhood adiposity (obesity, metabolic syndrome, hyperglycemia, CRP) versus those more influenced by BMI gain (hypertension, dyslipidemias) offers valuable insights for targeted public health interventions. The study reinforces the importance of early prevention strategies for cardiovascular diseases, emphasizing that interventions during childhood can have a lasting impact on adult health outcomes. The findings align with existing literature on the tracking of BMI and the long-term consequences of childhood obesity, while also contributing to the understanding of specific risk factor trajectories.
